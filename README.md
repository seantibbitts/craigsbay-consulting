Partnered with @kylednotm to scrape Craigslist and pull data from the eBay API for comparison and analysis purposes.

### Contents
1. Combining and Geocoding Craigslist Data Final.ipynb -- After the Craigslist data was compiled, I combined the datasets
and reverse-geocoded the locations to get the ZIP codes using the Google Maps API.
2. Concatenating Craigslist and eBay.ipynb -- I brought the Craigslist and eBay datasets into alignment as much as possible
and then concatenated them.
3. Scraping Craigslist Final.ipynb -- I used the requests and BeautifulSoup Python libraries to scrape the Redding, Sacramento,
Bakersfield and San Diego Craigslist sites, capturing categories, condition, latitude, longitude and price for each item (among
other data points).
